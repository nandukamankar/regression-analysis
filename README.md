Sales Forecasting for Rossmann - Project Readme

Project Overview: The goal of this project is to develop a robust sales forecasting model for Rossmann, a prominent drugstore chain with over 3,000 stores across seven European countries. The project utilizes historical sales data from 1,115 Rossmann stores, encompassing daily sales and relevant features. The challenge lies in predicting daily sales up to six weeks in advance, considering factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and temporary store closures.

Dataset: The dataset includes information on daily sales and various features for 1,115 Rossmann stores. Some stores experienced temporary closures for refurbishment, adding complexity to the forecasting task.

Objective: The primary objective is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set, leveraging historical sales data and associated factors. The accurate forecasting model aims to enhance operational efficiency, optimize inventory management, and improve decision-making at both store and corporate levels.

Insights and Conclusions:

Day-wise Sales Patterns:

Monday had higher sales, possibly due to Sunday closures, resulting in lower sales.
Validation of the hypothesis regarding the impact of store closures on sales patterns.
Promotional Impact:

Positive correlation between promotions and both customer footfall and sales.
Recommendations to encourage more stores to implement promotions.
Competition and Sales:

Stores with competition distances within 0-10 kms showed higher sales.
Suggested focus on busy locations with competition for optimal sales.
Store Type Analysis:

Store Type B, despite being fewer in number, exhibited the highest sales average.
Recommendation to increase the number of Store Type B outlets.
Outlier Analysis:

Outliers, often Store Type B or with ongoing promotions, demonstrated justifiable sales behavior.
Acknowledgment of the impact of promotions and store types on outlier patterns.
Model Performance:

Random Forest Tuned Model & Linear Regression provided the best results.
Minimal improvement observed from the basic Random Forest model, indicating optimal performance achieved.
Recommendations:

Encourage more stores to implement promotions for increased customer engagement.
Increase the number of Store Type B outlets due to their higher sales average.
Leverage seasonality by promoting and capitalizing on holiday sales.
Implications:

Improved customer satisfaction through optimized promotional strategies.
Enhanced revenue and market competitiveness in the dynamic retail industry.
Informed business decisions based on accurate sales forecasts.
Conclusion: The project's analysis provides valuable insights into sales patterns, promotions, and store types, contributing to the development of a robust forecasting model. The recommendations aim to empower Rossmann with strategic decisions, optimizing resources and driving growth in the competitive retail landscape.
